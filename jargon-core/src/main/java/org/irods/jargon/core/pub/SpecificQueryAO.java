	 * <code>
	 * SELECT c.parent_coll_name, c.coll_name, c.create_ts, c.modify_ts, c.coll_id, c.coll_owner_name, c.coll_owner_zone, c.coll_type,

	 *  JOIN r_user_main u ON a.user_id = u.user_id WHERE c.parent_coll_name = ? LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
	 * </code>

	 * code that prepares the returned result set, so that the 'count' fields in
	 * the result accurately reflect the
	 *
	 *
	 * @param specificQuery

	 * @param userDefinedOffset
	 *            <code>int</code> that represents an offset to use in the
	 *            returned record counts that is enforced within the sql itself.
	 *            This is used because users often use LIMIT and OFFSET
	 *            statements inside the actual SQL to accomplish custom paging.
