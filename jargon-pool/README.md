### Jargon pooling 

Support for pooling and caching of iRODS connections using commons pool

## NOTE ##

This functionality is currently being tested for WebDav and REST, it is currently not recommended for general use until this testing is complete.  

Configuration and monitoring extensions are planned for the future, so this should not be considered to have optimized configuration settings.
